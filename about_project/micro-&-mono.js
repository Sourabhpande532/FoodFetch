*@ABOUT: MONOLITH & MICROSERVICES ARCHITECTUERS

-Let's us try to this work with Actual data whch is coming from swiggy
      API it mean LIVE DATA ðŸ˜— -Let's Explore The world!! -World means outside
      thing which our application Doesn't Know single thing which is know as
      MICROSERVECES; -when we'v to build large application like swiggy or UBER
      or Amzon Flipcart do you really thing there is only one react project
      behind the sence obivious No.Not Possible ðŸ‘Ž @FACTL:UBER use 100 MONOLITH
      -Previously what we did in project we do all stuff in one Project like
      API,SMS,UI,notification,JSP(Java Circulate Pages) @FACT: for changing one
      we used to deploy whole Java application for one btn Change. -100 of
      developer work on 1 project 1 Repository it has such mess -such process
      know as ""MONOLITH"" few of them use the services but not preffer ref:
      ðŸ“„asset/old.png/ @NEW -So to get rid of complication World move toward
      MICROSERVECES -instead of having just one Project we'v small small
      defferent project with individual Repository of each one with Defferent
      PORT even the DB also defferent for individual Project.
      ref:ðŸ“„asset/microserves.png/micro.conn/ For UI - Defferent Repository &
      port like everyone for backend API,for Logs,login/logout,notification....
      @ADVANTAGE: -Every Team can have defferent Responsibility -Easy for teasy
      -for change btn only you've to deploy UI Project not whole application.
      -You Can use defferent deffernt STACK for UI use Java,for notification use
      pythan for authentication use GOLANG ....like -you don't need to concern
      about all one like logs,notification project,signin/signup & all. -we'r
      doing this Separtion of Concern(SOC) or single Responsibility -this is The
      whole application Big in Today's world!! HOW THIS ARE CONNECTED TAKE
      REFFERENCE OF ABOVE micro-conn.png  
      E.g @API: swiggy.com/ 4000 match to /dapi,or /signin,or /signup
      @NOTE: Defferent PORT BUT SAME DOMAIN name like swiggy.com that's a convection:

      The World for UI PROJECT This all one logs,authentication,Backend api and other x project that's why we utter LETS EXPLORE THE WORLD. take REFFERENCE of micro.png talk with world ...
