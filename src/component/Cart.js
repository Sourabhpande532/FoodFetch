{
  /* we've created cart see How do i get cartItems from store now via useSelector() hook use this one take e.g header.js 
  -what it execept useSelector it expect a function e.g store it is subsicribing to store 
  -Now what should I write after store = ? inside useSelector
  -Take a Note It's very important ask this question in iterviews
  -useSelector use for specially "Subscribe" the store because this is the place you'll tell what this COMPONENT subscribing to whom , what exact you'r COMPONENT subsicribing to!! what you'r subscribing to 

  -@STARTEGIES 
   @TARGET:Want to UPDATE Specific portion of App(cart) Not whole Store because its too huge 
   -if I write {store => store} It Subscribing/UPDATE whole Store 
   -What if i write {store=>store.cart} it Subscribing/UPDATE the cartSlice.js 
   -What if i write {store=>store.cart.items} it is Subscribing/UPDATE only small portion that array that we defined [] inside one
   
   This is where people make mistake over here what they do they generally subscribe the whole store & it's very bad thing bad Approach this is where you improve major perfonmance issue ! 
   instead this one 
   -------------------
  const store = useSelector((store) => store)
  return(
  <div className=' font-bold text-3xl'>Cart - {store.cart.item.length}</div>
  )
  --------------------
  why this is bad Approach because let's understand 
  take ref: ✅reducer.png 
  what if my cart(header one) subscribing to store what'll happend automagically everytime my store changes my cart will change & it'll re-render my COMPONENT
  -if i'm subscribing to "store"(store.js) everytime my store changees & it'will re-render the COMPONENT that's it's bad Approach in large scale big applications it's ellogical 
  --want to upadate Specific portion follow above methods because it upadate only item array [] not whole store 
  -because of this it doesn't subscribe to random thing instead cartSlice it user.. or anyother it update Specific one
  see above code!!
  Hence proof!
